# Week 1: C

- Machine Code: Sequences of 0's and 1's that are read in "patterns" to represent various characters, integers, or even instructions.

- Compiler: Translator of english code to machine code.

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Visual representation of code used to easily allow users to interact with buttons etc.
- Command Line Interface (CLI): Using the terminal window to type commands to perform or run actions/scripts.

To Run C Program in CS50 VS Code:

1. code filename.ext (source code)
2. make filename (compiler created file of the machine code)
3. ./filename (runs the compiled program)

Escape Sequences:

1. \n new line
2. \r
3. \" print quotation mark to screen
4. \'
5. \\

Header File: Written at the top of the file to give to access to "libraries". - Example: `#include <stdio.h>`

- Libraries:
  1. stdio.h
  2. cs50.h (CS50 only) built in functions for CS50 codespace:
     - get_char
     - get_double
     - get_float
     - get_int
     - get_long
     - get_string (similar to the input() function in Python)

- Placeholders/Format Codes:
  - %c
  - %f
  - %i
  - %li
  - %s

- CLI Commands
  - cd: change directory
  - cp: copy
  - ls: list
  - mkdir: make directory/folder
  - mv: move
  - rm: remove
  - rmdir: remove directory

- Types:
  - bool
  - char: single characters
  - double
  - float
  - int: small whole numbers
  - long: integers but bigger/longer
  - string: words or phrases

- Conditionals:
  if (x < y)
  {
  printf("x is less than y\n");
  }
  else if (x > y)
  {
  printf("x is greater than y\n");
  }
  else
  {
  printf("x is equal to y\n");
  }

- Operators:
  1. =
  2. >
  3. > =
  4. <
  5. <=
  6. ==
  7. -
  8. -
  9. -
  10. /
  11. %
  12. || -> "or" (in Python)
  13. && -> "and" (in Python)
  14. i-- -> decrease i by one
  15. i++ -> increase i by one

- Variable: House data or information as a literal word representation.
  - In C variables are declared their type before being defined.
    - Example: `int count = 0;`

- Loops:
  - for
  - while
  - do while: do an action for a long or while a condition is met/notmet.

- Constants: variables that the compiler or users can change.
  - Example: `const int n = 3`

- Comments: //

- Integer Overflow: exceeding the number of bits needed to call or represent a large integer value.

- Truncation: overwriting a calculated value to represent an appropriate type.

- Floating-point Imprecision:
